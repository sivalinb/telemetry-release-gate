# Setup

## Portable environment

Use Python 3.12 on macOS or Linux. Create a virtual environment and install `requirements-dev.txt`. The Streamlit app listens on loopback by default. `make app` uses port 8501. Windows process-group behavior has not been validated; use WSL for portable checks.

## Pkl

Install Pkl from https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/pkl-cli/index.html. Development validation uses Pkl 0.32.1. Set `PKL_BIN` to an absolute executable path if it is not on PATH. `config/default.pkl` is the authoring source. Run `python scripts/export_config.py` after editing; commit the Pkl and generated JSON together. A stale export raises an error. `pkl test config/tests.pkl` checks configuration facts. UI edits additionally pass through Python runtime models; arbitrary user-authored Pkl files are never evaluated.

## Apple Container

Use an Apple silicon Mac with supported macOS 26. Download the official signed installer from https://github.com/apple/container/releases. Development validation targets Container 1.5.0. Start it using `container system start` and install the recommended kernel when prompted. Set `CONTAINER_BIN` if using a nonstandard installation. Verify `container list --format json` succeeds.

Pre-pull the images before timed experiments:

```bash
container image pull python:3.12-slim
container image pull otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.120.0
container image pull prom/prometheus:v3.2.1
```

The application creates only `lab-...-<random>` containers and removes those exact names. It does not run global prune or delete unrelated containers. Interrupted host processes can leave VMs behind: inspect `container list --all`, then delete only the names from your run. Do not run the live app as a publicly accessible unauthenticated service.

## Model option

The AI reviewer defaults to local TF-IDF retrieval and needs no model. To enable synthesis, supply an HTTP loopback/private-network or HTTPS remote chat-completions endpoint in the UI. Set `LAB_MODEL_API_KEY` in the environment if required; never commit it. The UI sends only after Answer is clicked. A local llama.cpp server is supported. Model licensing and disk/RAM requirements vary.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing runtime: install/start Container; the application will not execute submitted sandbox code on the host.
- First job exceeds deadline: pre-pull the image and retry after verifying runtime health.
- `Pkl snapshot is stale`: regenerate the export using the documented CLI.
- Empty stats: increase probe duration; do not substitute zero usage.
- Public HTTP 403/429: wait for upstream rate limits or use cached/downloaded data. No GitHub token is required for the public catalogue.
- OTLP exporter connection failures: remove the optional OTLP endpoint or start a collector. Local JSONL evidence remains available.
- Model errors: verify `/health`, model identity, available memory, and `/v1/chat/completions` support.

## macOS filesystem access

On macOS, a background virtualization helper may not be able to access files under protected folders such as Documents. Live jobs stage their specific input and workload files into per-run temporary directories before read-only mounting them. The model launcher stages only the selected GGUF file. Install the Container executable in its normal vendor location rather than running the daemon from a protected Documents directory. No broad filesystem-permission change is required by these projects.
